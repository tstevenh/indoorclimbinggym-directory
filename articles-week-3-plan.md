# Week 3 SEO + Affiliate Conversion Sprint Plan (Feb 19)

## Goal
Publish 5 net-new US-focused SEO articles with high opportunity (good volume + lower KD + commercial/local intent), while avoiding overlap with existing blog topics and routes.

## Existing Content Audit Summary
Reviewed current posts in `src/content/blog` and dynamic blog routes (`/blog/[...slug]`, `/blog/[...page]`, `/blog/[category]`, `/guides/[...slug]`, RSS route) to avoid duplicate intent.

Already covered themes include:
- Beginner gym intro and getting started
- General climbing shoe selection and beginner shoe guides
- General gear guide
- Membership costs/value
- Indoor wall overview and building a wall (broad)
- Workout/fitness benefits

## Selected Week 3 Topics

| Primary Keyword | Intent | Volume | KD | CPC (USD) | Planned Slug | Why this is a good opportunity |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|---|
| rock climbing harness | Commercial | 2400 | 18 | 0.35 | `rock-climbing-harness-guide` | Strong commercial intent, low KD, high relevance to beginner/intermediate conversion paths. |
| rock climbing holds | Commercial | 1600 | 25 | 0.43 | `rock-climbing-holds-guide` | Product-driven keyword with DIY + buying intent; complements existing wall content without duplicating it. |
| rock climbing birthday party | Commercial | 1900 | 10 | 1.35 | `rock-climbing-birthday-party-guide` | Very low KD and high local/commercial intent; supports gym discovery and event conversions. |
| bouldering crash pad | Commercial | 2400 | 28 | 0.00 | `bouldering-crash-pad-guide` | Strong gear-buying intent with clear affiliate fit, lower overlap with existing content, and practical safety angle. |
| kids climbing shoes | Commercial | 1000 | 14 | 0.00 | `kids-climbing-shoes-guide` | Low-KD, parent purchase intent, and new segment coverage without cannibalizing existing adult shoe guides. |

## Exclusions (to prevent duplication)
- `bouldering grades` (overlaps existing `climbing-grades-explained` cluster)
- `bouldering shoes` (overlaps existing shoe cluster)
- `beginner climbing shoes` (already close to existing beginner shoe content)
- `best climbing shoes` (likely overlaps current shoe decision content)
- `home bouldering wall` (too close to existing "how to build a climbing wall")

## Publishing Notes
- All five articles include:
  - internal links to existing relevant pages
  - authoritative external links
  - at least one `AffiliateBlock`
  - FAQ section
  - SEO-safe descriptions (<=160 chars)
