const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'Why do climbing gyms have saunas?',
    answer: 'Saunas aid in muscle recovery, reduce delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS), improve flexibility, and help prevent injuries. After intense climbing sessions, sauna use increases blood flow to tired muscles, accelerates metabolic waste removal, and promotes relaxation. Many elite climbers incorporate regular sauna sessions into their training regimens.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the difference between infrared and traditional saunas at climbing gyms?',
    answer: 'Traditional saunas heat the air to 150-195°F using electric or wood stoves, while infrared saunas use infrared lamps to directly heat your body at lower temperatures (120-150°F). Infrared saunas penetrate deeper into muscle tissue and are often preferred for athletic recovery. Traditional saunas create a more intense heat experience and are better for cardiovascular benefits.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long should I use the sauna after climbing?',
    answer: 'Most climbers benefit from 15-20 minute sauna sessions after training. Start with shorter durations (10 minutes) if you are new to sauna use. Always hydrate well before and after. Some athletes do multiple short sessions with cool-down breaks in between for maximum recovery benefits.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can sauna use improve climbing performance?',
    answer: 'Yes! Regular sauna use improves cardiovascular endurance, increases heat shock protein production (aiding muscle recovery), enhances flexibility when combined with stretching, and may improve mental toughness. Studies show heat adaptation can boost endurance performance by 5-10%. Many professional climbers use saunas as part of their training.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Are climbing gym saunas included in membership?',
    answer: 'Most climbing gyms with saunas include access as part of standard membership or day pass fees. Some premium facilities may charge extra for sauna-only visits or package it with other wellness amenities like yoga classes. Always check with the specific gym regarding their sauna access policies.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What should I bring for sauna use at a climbing gym?',
    answer: 'Bring a towel to sit on (required at most facilities), water bottle for hydration, and shower flip-flops. Wear a swimsuit or gym shorts. Most climbing gyms with saunas have showers nearby for post-sauna cool-downs. Some provide towels, but bring your own to be safe.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is it safe to use the sauna immediately after hard climbing?',
    answer: 'Yes, but listen to your body. Wait 5-10 minutes after climbing to let your heart rate normalize and rehydrate before entering the sauna. Avoid sauna use if you feel dizzy, overheated, or dehydrated. Pregnant women and people with certain medical conditions should consult doctors before sauna use.',

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-granite mb-6">The Recovery Advantage: Saunas for Climbers</h2>

    <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Climbing places unique demands on your body - intense finger strength, sustained core tension, and powerful dynamic movements create localized fatigue that can limit training frequency. Forward-thinking climbing gyms have recognized that recovery amenities like saunas are not luxury additions but essential tools for serious athletes. These wellness-focused facilities understand that optimal performance comes from balancing hard training with effective recovery.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Sauna use after climbing sessions offers multiple physiological benefits backed by scientific research. Heat exposure increases blood flow to fatigued muscles, accelerating the removal of metabolic waste products like lactic acid. This enhanced circulation delivers fresh oxygen and nutrients to damaged muscle fibers, speeding recovery and reducing next-day soreness. Many climbers report being able to train harder and more frequently when incorporating regular sauna sessions into their routines.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-granite mb-4 mt-8">Types of Saunas in Climbing Facilities</h3>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        The best climbing gyms with sauna amenities typically offer infrared saunas, though some premium facilities provide both infrared and traditional Finnish-style saunas. Infrared saunas use infrared lamps to directly heat your body rather than heating the surrounding air. Operating at lower temperatures (120-150°F versus 150-195°F for traditional saunas), infrared models are often preferred by athletes because the deeper tissue penetration targets muscle recovery more effectively.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Traditional dry saunas create an intensely hot environment that promotes heavy sweating and cardiovascular stress, offering different benefits. The higher temperatures provide excellent cardiovascular conditioning and may offer superior detoxification effects. Some climbers rotate between sauna types or use traditional saunas for general wellness and infrared for targeted post-workout recovery. The most comprehensive climbing gyms offer both options, letting members choose based on their recovery needs.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        When evaluating gyms with saunas, consider capacity and availability. Premium facilities invest in multiple sauna units or larger communal saunas to minimize wait times during peak hours. Look for gyms where sauna access is included in standard membership rather than requiring premium upgrades. The best facilities position saunas near shower areas and create relaxation spaces where you can cool down between sauna rounds.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-granite mb-4 mt-8">Maximizing Sauna Benefits for Climbing Performance</h3>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Strategic sauna use can enhance your climbing training in several ways. Post-workout sauna sessions reduce delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS), letting you maintain higher training frequency. The heat also improves flexibility - many climbers combine sauna time with stretching protocols, finding that warmed muscles respond better to mobility work. This combination is particularly valuable for climbers struggling with tight hip flexors or limited shoulder mobility.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Heat shock proteins, produced during sauna exposure, help protect and repair damaged muscle tissue. Regular sauna use upregulates these protective proteins, potentially reducing injury risk during high-intensity training blocks. The cardiovascular stress from sauna heat also triggers adaptations similar to low-intensity cardio - increased plasma volume and improved heat tolerance that can boost endurance on long boulder problems or sustained route climbing.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Beyond physical recovery, saunas offer psychological benefits often overlooked by climbers. The forced relaxation of sauna time provides mental recovery from intense training sessions and creates space for reflective visualization of climbing projects. Many elite climbers report that their best problem-solving insights come during quiet sauna sessions, where they mentally rehearse sequences and strategize about challenging moves.
