## Why This Rebrand Matters

Rebrands in sports signal identity shifts. They tell you who's invited. Who the sport serves. Where it's going next.

On December 10, 2025, the International Federation of Sport Climbing dropped its acronym. The **IFSC** became **World Climbing**. It is the first name change since 2007.

You might think this is just marketing. New logo, fresh colors, updated website. But rebrands like this happen when a sport outgrows its old shell. When the gap between what you are and what you're called becomes too wide to ignore.

Climbing went Olympic. It exploded in gyms worldwide. Millions of people now climb who never heard of the IFSC. So the question becomes clear: is this just a new logo, or a signal that climbing is entering a different phase entirely?

## From IFSC to World Climbing: What Actually Changed

### The New Name and Philosophy

**World Climbing.**

Two words that replace an acronym most climbers couldn't define. The name says exactly what it means. This is climbing. For the world.

The new motto frames it clearly: *"We get the World Climbing."*

Not "We organize elite competitions." Not "We govern sport climbing rules."

**We get the world climbing.**

The emphasis lands on participation. Culture. Global access. The idea that climbing belongs to everyone who touches a hold, not just the athletes on TV.

### Why Now?

National federations approved the change back in October 2023. But the rollout happened now, at the end of 2025, because timing matters.

Tokyo Olympics put climbing on the map. Paris cemented it. The post-Olympic momentum keeps building, and the sport needs a name that matches where it's going.

There's also the audience shift. Younger climbers grow up digitally native. They find climbing through Instagram, TikTok, YouTube. They don't search for "IFSC World Cup results." They search for climbing gyms, climbing tips, climbing near me. The rebrand acknowledges this reality.

## The New Logo Design: More Than Visual Polish

### Symbolism in the Design

The new logo shows a globe formed from climbing holds. Look closer and you'll see three disciplines woven together. Bouldering routes. Lead routes. Speed routes. All interlocking to create the sphere.

It's clean. Simple. You recognize it as climbing instantly.

### Interwoven Routes as Metaphor

The routes don't run parallel. They cross. Intersect. Form one unified structure.

This visual choice matters because it reflects how climbing culture actually works. Different styles, different disciplines, different backgrounds. But we're all on the same wall.

Global community. Different paths. Shared space.

### Why Branding Matters for Climbing

Consistency helps people follow the sport. When events, broadcasts, and digital platforms all use the same visual language, it's easier for casual fans to recognize what they're watching. It lowers the barrier to entry for people who might want to get into climbing but don't know where to start.

Strong branding also helps sponsors and partners understand what they're investing in. Clear identity attracts resources. Resources grow the sport.

## Leadership's Vision: What World Climbing Stands For

### Marco Scolaris' Core Message

Marco Scolaris, president of World Climbing, framed the rebrand around heritage and future.

"This new brand represents every part of our sport," he said. The goal is to honor where climbing came from while embracing where it's headed. Not either/or. Both.

### Climbing as a Shared Journey

Scolaris used an interesting phrase: *"Setting the holds on the wall of life."*

It sounds poetic, but the meaning is practical. Climbing, at its core, is about progress. You move higher. You get stronger. You move faster. And you do it alongside other people working toward their own goals.

Collective progress. Not competition alone.

### Shift in Audience Focus

The old IFSC spoke primarily to federations, athletes, and competition organizers. **World Climbing** speaks to fans. Gym climbers. Youth programs. Partners. Anyone who wants to be part of climbing culture.

This is a wider tent.

## What Changes for Fans and Climbers in 2026

### Competition Structure Updates

The **IFSC World Cup** becomes the **World Climbing Series**.

Same competitions. New name. The 2026 season launches with this branding across all events. If you follow competitive climbing, expect to see World Climbing graphics, logos, and messaging at every stop on the tour.

### Visual and Brand Rollout

The rebrand doesn't happen overnight. Throughout 2026, you'll see the new look roll out across continents. Event signage. Broadcast graphics. Social media. Website redesigns. Everything unified under the World Climbing identity.

It'll feel different watching events this year. More cohesive.

### Continental Federations Rebrand

Continental organizations are adopting the name too. **World Climbing Europe**. **World Climbing Asia**. Others will follow.

This creates consistency at every level. Local federations connect to continental bodies, which connect to the global organization. One clear structure.

## Why This Rebrand Matters Beyond Elite Competitions

### Climbing's Growth Happens Locally

Most climbers never compete in World Cups. They start in local gyms. They climb with friends. They work on projects in their home city. The grassroots layer is where climbing actually lives.

The rebrand recognizes this. World Climbing positions itself as the global face of a sport that happens everywhere, not just on competition walls.

### Stronger Global Brand Means Stronger Local Ecosystems

When the sport has a clear, recognizable identity, it helps local gyms. Gyms benefit from climbing's visibility. More people see climbing content online. More people get curious. More people walk into gyms for the first time.

A rising tide lifts all boats.

### The Sport is Becoming More Accessible

Climbing used to feel niche. You needed to know someone, find the right gear shop, learn the unwritten rules. Now it's more open. Gyms make it easy to start. The global identity makes it easier to discover.

Less intimidating. More community-driven. More discoverable.

## What This Means for You as a Climber

### More Pathways Into the Sport

You might watch a **World Climbing Series** event and think, "I want to try that." Now there's a clearer path. You can find gyms. You can find communities. You can connect the thing you saw on screen to something you can actually do.

The gap between spectator and participant shrinks.

### Opportunity to Explore Beyond Your Home Wall

The global identity makes traveling for climbing feel more accessible. If you're visiting a new city, you can search for indoor climbing gyms and know you'll find quality facilities. The shared culture makes it easier to walk into a gym anywhere in the world and feel like you belong.

Travel. Train. Connect with global climbing culture.

### Climbing is No Longer Niche

It's worldwide. The rebrand to World Climbing makes this official. You're part of something bigger than your local gym. Bigger than your home country. You're part of a global movement of people who climb walls because it's challenging, fun, and deeply human.

## Find Your Place in World Climbing

The rebrand's core idea is simple: everyone belongs on the wall.

You don't need to be an elite athlete. You don't need to climb V10 or send 5.13. You just need to want to climb.

Your next step might be finding a gym near you. Or exploring a new city and checking out their climbing scene. Or connecting with other climbers online and learning about different styles.

World Climbing is the global identity. But your entry point is local.

The wall is waiting.
