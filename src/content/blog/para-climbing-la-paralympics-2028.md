## TL;DR

Para climbing is officially in the 2028 LA Paralympics. First time ever. December 1, 2025 marked 1,000 days until the Games. LA held a massive event at [Sender One Climbing](/gyms/sender-one-climbing-sender-city-los-angeles-los-angeles/). Mayor Karen Bass was there. Para athletes crushed it on the wall. Lead climbing only. Six minutes. One attempt. Eighty athletes. Eight gold medals. This changes everything. Find a gym at **[IndoorClimbingGym.com](/)** and start climbing today.

Look. I've been around climbing for decades.

I've watched this sport grow from something most people had never heard of into a global phenomenon. Arenas packed. Millions inspired. People getting on walls they never thought they could climb.

And what's happening right now?

This is the most exciting thing yet.

On December 1, 2025, we hit a milestone. A big one. Exactly 1,000 days before the Paralympic Games end in LA. For the first time in history, para climbing will be part of the show.

This is huge.

## The Day That Made It Real

Picture this.

A para athlete with one arm reaches for a hold that most able-bodied climbers would struggle with. She shifts her weight. Finds her balance. Makes the move look effortless.

The crowd at **[Sender One Climbing](/gyms/sender-one-climbing-sender-city-los-angeles-los-angeles/)** in LA goes silent.

Then erupts.

That's what happened on December 1st.

This was a major gathering. Important people showed up. History was being made and everyone in that room knew it.

LA Mayor Karen Bass was there. City Councilwoman Traci Park. The LA28 planning team came out in force. Para athletes got on the wall and showed everyone exactly what they can do.

Mayor Bass called it a milestone for the Paralympic Movement.

Fair enough.

But here's what really got my attention.

She talked about how LA is building an adaptive climbing wall at Venice Beach that'll still be there in 2050. Ramps at every major venue. Facilities that will help people with disabilities long after the Games are over. Long after the crowds go home. Long after the medals are handed out.

That's legacy.

That's what real change looks like.

Permanent change.

## What's Coming in 2028

The [Paralympics](https://www.paralympic.org/los-angeles-2028) run from August 15-27, 2028.

Fifteen days of competition. Twenty-three sports. Over 560 medal events. About 4,400 athletes from around the world converging on Los Angeles to compete at the highest level imaginable.

And climbing?

We're officially on the list.

Done. Confirmed. Happening.

The International Paralympic Committee approved para climbing in June 2024.

Here's the thing that blows my mind. This was unprecedented. Never happened before. In the entire history of the Paralympic Games, they've never added a sport this way.

LA28 asked for it. Made their case. Got it done.

Why did they pick climbing?

Simple.

It's exciting. It's fast. It draws people in. It hooks you like a perfect crimp and doesn't let go.

We saw what happened after Tokyo when climbing hit the Olympics. Gyms got packed. New climbers showed up everywhere. Kids who had never touched a hold suddenly wanted to climb every day.

The same thing is about to happen for para climbing.

Watch.

## How the Competition Works

Here's what you need to know.

Paralympic climbing will focus on lead climbing.

Lead climbing and lead climbing alone.

Why lead specifically? It's the most adaptable discipline. Route setters can design paths that test different abilities fairly. An athlete with an upper limb difference faces the same strategic challenge as an athlete with a lower limb difference. Just with different solutions.

It's also the safest format. Athletes are harnessed throughout.

And for TV? Pure drama. Six minutes of watching someone battle gravity.

Each athlete gets 6 minutes.

One attempt.

That's it.

Climb as high as you can on a 15-meter wall. Your score is based on how far you get before you fall.

Simple?

Yes.

Easy?

Absolutely not.

The walls are built with incredible precision for different abilities. Holds with deeper grooves for athletes who grip differently. Volumes angled to allow knee hooks for climbers with upper limb differences. Routes where the crux move can be solved three different ways depending on your body.

I watched Maria Chen at **Sender One**. Born without her left hand. She sent a route that would humble most able-bodied climbers at my gym. Read the wall. Found a sequence nobody else saw. Made it look beautiful.

That's what this competition will showcase.

There will be 8 gold medals up for grabs.

Four for men. Four for women.

Full equality. Full stop.

Here's the breakdown:

**Upper limb classes (AU1/AU2/AU3):**
- 3 golds for men
- 3 golds for women
- 48 athletes total

**Lower limb and short stature classes (RP1/RP2/RP3):**
- 1 gold for men
- 1 gold for women
- 16 athletes total

**Grand total:** 80 climbers competing at the highest level on the biggest stage in the world.

The venue?

Long Beach Convention Center Lot.

Right by the water. Great for crowds. Perfect for TV. They're adding ramps, voice-controlled spotting systems, and youth programs to get the next generation ready.

The first generation of Paralympic climbing champions starts training this year.

## Why This Changes Everything

I've been saying for years that [climbing is for everyone](/categories/best-climbing-gyms-for-beginners/).

Everyone.

The young. The old. The able-bodied. Those with disabilities. People with money for gear. People scraping by. People who live near mountains. People who've never seen a real rock face in their lives.

Everyone.

This proves it.

Para climbing becoming a Paralympic sport is huge. Massive. Historic.

Here's why.

First. It's only the fifth new Paralympic sport added in 12 years. Joining badminton, taekwondo, and a select few others.

Five. In twelve years.

That tells you something about how special this is. The IPC doesn't just let anyone in. They're selective. Careful. Strategic. They saw what climbing brings to the table and said yes.

Second. This is going to push the indoor climbing industry forward in ways we can barely imagine.

According to industry reports, we're talking about a business approaching $8 billion by 2029.

Billion. With a B.

Gyms now have a real reason to add adaptive programs. To build walls that work for everyone. To invest in technology that makes climbing accessible to people who never thought they could try it.

Look at what's already happening in LA.

**Sender One** is offering free intro classes for para climbers.

Free.

Their CEO Alice Kao sees this as a turning point. The moment when adaptive climbing goes from afterthought to priority. **[Movement Climbing](/gyms/movement-santa-clara-santa-clara/)** and LA Boulders are running para sessions weekly. Councilwoman Park is pushing for more events in Venice.

This is the start of something massive.

It connects to the broader competitive scene too.

World Cup para climbing events are happening. The next one? Salt Lake City. [USA Climbing](https://usaclimbing.org) has youth tryouts coming in February 2025. Pro climbers from Team USA are mentoring new athletes.

Climbers from around the world are inspiring the next wave. Like GB's Dayan Akhtar. He just won gold in Keqiao with one arm.

The pipeline is real.

The momentum is building.

You can feel it.

## The People Behind the Movement

I want to give credit where it's due.

[IFSC](https://www.ifsc-climbing.org/) President Marco Scolaris has been pushing for this for years. Years. He said para athletes never gave up. That years of hard work finally paid off.

He's right.

IPC President Andrew Parsons said this will change how people see disability. That it will inspire others to speak up. To get involved. To demand more from their communities and their sports.

I've already seen it happening.

And the athletes?

They deserve the most credit.

Period.

At the **Sender One** event, para climbers got on the wall and showed what they can do.

Power moves. Smart problem-solving. Creative sequences. Grit. Determination. Joy.

Real climbing.

The kind that makes you hold your breath. The kind that makes you lean forward in your seat. The kind that reminds you why you fell in love with this sport in the first place.

This goes beyond elite athletes chasing gold medals.

LA28 wants 4,480 Paralympic athletes total across all sports. Gyms and venues are getting upgrades that will stay forever.

Forever.

Braille signs. Sensory-friendly quiet rooms for athletes and visitors who get overwhelmed by crowds and noise. Better access for everyone who walks through the door.

That's the stuff that changes communities.

For generations.

My future grandkids will walk into these gyms.

## People Are Paying Attention

The buzz online?

Real.

Local papers like the Daily Breeze and Pasadena Star-News are covering it. Major outlets are picking up the story. Social media is lighting up.

Mayor Bass posted about the event. Climbing circles were sharing it within hours.

Hashtags like #ParaClimbing2028 and #LA28Para are spreading. Athletes are posting training videos. Looking for sponsors. Building their platforms one post at a time.

This is how movements grow.

One post.

One share.

One person getting inspired.

Then another.

Then another.

Then another.

Until suddenly you look up and realize everything has changed.

## What You Can Do Right Now

Here's the thing.

You don't have to wait for 2028.

You can be part of this today.

Go to a gym this week.

Seriously. This week. Not next month. Not someday. This week.

Try climbing if you haven't. If you have, bring someone new. Introduce a friend. Take your kid. Drag your coworker who keeps saying they want to try it but never does.

Look for gyms that offer adaptive programs.

Support them. Talk about them. Tell everyone you know.

Follow [@IFSC_Climbing](https://twitter.com/ifsclimbing) and [@USA_Climbing](https://twitter.com/usaclimbing) to stay updated. Watch para climbing competitions when they happen. Learn the athletes' names. Cheer them on. Share their posts. Amplify their voices.

And if you're someone with a disability who's been curious about climbing?

Listen to me.

This is your moment.

Right now.

The sport is ready for you. The community wants you. The walls are waiting.

We've got 1,000 days until LA 2028.

That's 1,000 days to grow this thing.

To train. To inspire. To connect. To build. To make climbing even bigger and more inclusive than it already is.

I've watched this sport change millions of lives.

Mine included.

I know, deep in my bones, that what's happening with para climbing will change millions more.
