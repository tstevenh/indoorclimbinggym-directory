## The Gear Myth

Walk into any climbing gym and you will see climbers with hundreds of dollars of gear. Specialized shoes, harnesses festooned with gear loops, chalk bags with custom designs, and enough carabiners to outfit a small expedition. It is easy to think you need all of it to start climbing.

You do not.

The truth is that climbing requires remarkably little equipment to get started. Most of what you see experienced climbers carrying is either for specific types of climbing you are not doing yet, or personal preference items that make climbing more comfortable but are not essential.

This guide covers what you actually need to start climbing, what you can add later, and what you should ignore for now.

## The Absolute Essentials

If you are climbing indoors at a gym, you need exactly four pieces of personal gear to get started.

### 1. Climbing Shoes

You cannot climb without shoes designed for the sport. Regular sneakers do not stick to climbing holds. You need rubber designed to grip plastic and rock.

For your first pair, focus on fit and comfort over performance. A shoe that hurts your feet will make every climbing session miserable. You will find detailed guidance in our [rock climbing shoes guide](/blog/rock-climbing-shoes-beginners-guide), but the short version is this: buy a neutral, comfortable shoe from a reputable brand and do not overthink it.

### 2. Harness

If you want to rope climb, you need a harness. This is the piece of equipment that connects you to the rope and keeps you safe if you fall.

Harnesses all do the same basic job, but they vary in comfort, adjustability, and weight. For beginners, comfort matters more than weight. You will spend time hanging in your harness while you learn to belay and rest between attempts.

Look for a harness with:
- Padded waist belt and leg loops
- Adjustable leg loops (your legs may swell slightly during a session)
- Four gear loops (you will not use them all yet, but you will grow into them)
- A belay loop rated for climbing

Most gym climbers can get away with a basic, affordable harness for their first year. You do not need the ultralight alpine model or the specialized sport climbing harness. If you are just getting started, our [beginner's guide to climbing gyms](/blog/beginners-guide-to-climbing-gyms) covers what to expect on your first visit.

### 3. Belay Device

The belay device is what your partner uses to manage the rope while you climb. It creates friction that allows them to hold your weight if you fall, and controls your descent when you lower down.

There are several types of belay devices, but beginners should start with an assisted-braking device. These have a mechanism that automatically locks the rope if your partner lets go, adding a layer of safety while they are learning.

The <a href="https://www.petzl.com/US/en/Sport/Belay-devices/GRIGRI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Petzl Grigri</a> is the most popular assisted-braking device for good reason. It is reliable, durable, and widely understood by climbers everywhere. If you ever climb with a partner who has never used your specific device, they will almost certainly know how to use a Grigri.

### 4. Chalk and Chalk Bag

Chalk keeps your hands dry. Dry hands grip better. Better grip means you climb better.

Climbing chalk is simply magnesium carbonate, the same stuff gymnasts use. It absorbs sweat and oils from your skin, keeping friction high between your hands and the holds.

You do not need fancy chalk. Plain, loose chalk works perfectly well. Some brands like <a href="https://frictionlabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Friction Labs</a> add drying agents or use higher purity magnesium carbonate, but the basic stuff works fine for beginners.

You will need a chalk bag to hold it. Chalk bags are simple: a small pouch with a closure at the top and a loop to attach to your harness. Pick one you like the look of. Functionally, they are all about the same.

## What You Can Rent (For Now)

Most climbing gyms rent essential safety equipment. While you are figuring out whether climbing is something you will stick with, renting makes financial sense.

**Shoes:** Rent until you are climbing at least twice a month. Rental shoes are rarely comfortable, but they work for learning.

**Harness:** Many gyms include harness rental in the day pass price or charge a nominal fee. Rent until you buy your own.

**Belay Device:** Some gyms require you to use their devices for safety reasons. Check before buying.

**Chalk:** Most gyms sell chalk by the ounce, which is perfect for beginners who do not need a full bag yet.

The break-even point for buying versus renting is typically around ten to fifteen sessions. If you climb more than that, owning your own gear becomes cheaper. See our breakdown of [climbing gym costs](/blog/how-much-does-climbing-gym-cost) for detailed pricing information.

## What Can Wait

Experienced climbers carry a lot of gear that beginners do not need yet. Here is what you can ignore for your first few months.

### Climbing-Specific Clothing

Regular athletic wear works fine for gym climbing. You do not need specialized climbing pants or shirts. Wear something comfortable that allows full range of motion.

Once you start climbing outdoors, you might want pants that resist abrasion from rough rock. But for the gym, your gym clothes are fine.

### Crash Pad

Crash pads are for bouldering outdoors. If you are climbing in a gym, the floor is already padded. Do not buy a crash pad until you are ready to climb outside.

### Quickdraws

Quickdraws connect the rope to bolts on sport climbs. They are essential for outdoor lead climbing and unnecessary for gym climbing. Most gyms have their own quickdraws permanently installed on the walls.

### Rope

Gyms provide ropes for top-roping. When you start lead climbing, you will need your own rope, but that is months or years away for most beginners.

### Protection (Cams, Nuts, Hexes)

Traditional climbing gear is for placing your own protection in cracks. It is expensive, technical, and completely unnecessary for gym climbing. Save this category for when you have years of experience and are ready to climb multi-pitch trad routes.

### Grigri Accessories

You will see climbers with belay gloves, belay glasses, and various other accessories. These add comfort and convenience but are not necessary for beginners.

## Building Your Kit Over Time

You do not need to buy everything at once. Here is a sensible progression for building your climbing kit.

### Month 1-2: The Basics

Start with shoes and a chalk bag. These are personal items that you will use every session. Rent everything else until you are sure climbing is something you will stick with.

**Investment:** Around one hundred to one hundred fifty dollars

### Month 3-6: Add the Harness

Once you are climbing regularly and ready to learn to belay, buy a harness. You will need it to start rope climbing independently.

**Investment:** Around fifty to eighty dollars

### Month 6-12: Complete the Kit

Add a belay device and start building out your accessories. By now you know what kind of climbing you enjoy and can make informed choices about what gear matters to you.

**Investment:** Around one hundred to one hundred fifty dollars

### Year 2 and Beyond: Specialize

Once you have a year of climbing under your belt, you will know whether you want to focus on bouldering, sport climbing, trad climbing, or some combination. At this point, you can start buying specialized gear for your chosen discipline.

## How to Shop Smart

Climbing gear is expensive, but there are ways to stretch your budget.

### Buy Last Year's Model

Climbing gear does not change much year to year. Last year's harness or shoe model is almost always functionally identical to this year's, but costs significantly less. Look for clearance sales at the end of each season.

### Shop Sales

Outdoor retailers have major sales several times per year. Memorial Day, Labor Day, and Black Friday are particularly good times to buy gear. Plan your purchases around these sales.

### Buy Used (Carefully)

Some gear can be bought used safely. Harnesses, if they have not been fallen on heavily and are not past their expiration date, can be a good used purchase. Shoes can be resoled and reused. Never buy a used rope or carabiners. The risk is not worth the savings.

### Prioritize Fit Over Brand

A well-fitting budget shoe climbs better than a poorly fitting premium shoe. Do not get sucked into buying the most expensive gear because you think it will make you climb better. Fit matters more than price.

## Gear Safety Basics

Your climbing gear keeps you alive. Treat it with respect. The <a href="https://americanalpineclub.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Alpine Club</a> publishes annual reports on climbing accidents, and gear failure—while rare—does happen when equipment is not properly maintained.

### Inspect Regularly

Before every climb, check your gear for damage. Look for frayed harness straps, worn belay device tubes, and delaminating shoe rubber. If something looks questionable, retire it.

### Retire on Schedule

Climbing gear has a lifespan. Harnesses typically last three to five years with regular use. Ropes need replacement after heavy falls or when the sheath shows wear. Shoes last six months to a year of regular gym use.

When in doubt, replace it. The cost of new gear is trivial compared to the cost of an accident caused by worn equipment.

### Learn Proper Use

Gear only works if you use it correctly. Take a class or have an experienced climber teach you proper technique for putting on your harness, tying knots, and belaying. Never assume you know what you are doing without instruction.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much does it cost to get started with climbing gear

The bare minimum is around one hundred dollars for shoes and chalk. A complete basic kit with shoes, harness, belay device, and chalk runs around two hundred fifty to three hundred fifty dollars if you buy new.

### Should I buy all my gear at once or piece by piece

Piece by piece makes more sense for most beginners. Start with shoes, add a harness when you are ready to learn to belay, and complete the kit over time. This lets you spread out the cost and figure out what you actually need.

### Is expensive gear worth it

Sometimes. Premium shoes often use better rubber and more precise construction. High-end harnesses are lighter and more comfortable for long routes. But for beginners, mid-range gear is perfectly adequate. Upgrade when your skill level justifies it.

### Can I share gear with a partner

You can share a rope and quickdraws, but personal gear like harnesses, shoes, and chalk bags should not be shared for hygiene and safety reasons. Your harness is sized to you. Someone else's harness may not fit correctly.

### What gear do I need for outdoor climbing

Outdoor climbing requires everything you need for gym climbing plus a rope, quickdraws or trad gear, a helmet, and appropriate clothing. Start in the gym and add outdoor gear as you progress. Browse our [gym directory](/search) to find a place to build your skills before heading outdoors.

## The Bottom Line

Climbing gear is simple. You need shoes to stand on holds, a harness to connect to the rope, a belay device for your partner to manage that rope, and chalk to keep your hands dry. Everything else is optional.

Do not let gear decisions slow you down. Buy the basics, get to the gym, and start climbing. You will figure out what else you need as you go.

The best climber is not the one with the most expensive gear. It is the one who shows up consistently and focuses on technique. The gear is just there to keep you safe while you learn.
