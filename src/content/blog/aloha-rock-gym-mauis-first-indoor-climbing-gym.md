## TL;DR

Aloha Rock Gym is set to become Maui's first indoor climbing gym after more than a decade of work and major setbacks, including the 2023 fires. Construction is done, gear is in place, and they're waiting only for the final county permit. Co-founder Jeff Jackson and a small team built this space with community at the center, offering tall roped walls, bouldering, full training setups, and the Kōkua Program to support local youth and fire-affected families. Expected opening: late November or early December. Want to [explore more indoor climbing gyms nationwide](/search)? Visit IndoorClimbingGym.com.

Some stories build slowly. Others break open all at once. Aloha Rock Gym somehow does both.

For years, Maui climbers trained wherever they could: garage walls with worn foot chips, beach boulders weathered by salt and wind, pull-up bars welded into backyards. Anything to stay sharp. And the dream of a real [indoor climbing gym](/guides/beginners-guide-to-climbing-gyms)? It hung in the air like a high crux move you know your body can do, but the timing never lines up… until suddenly it does.

Aloha Rock Gym is now right on the edge of opening. Not someday. Not "when things calm down." Now. Almost.

## Rising After a Hard Season

This project took shape slowly over many years. It began more than ten years ago, long before anyone imagined how much the island would change. And while the dream was steady, the process wasn't. The last four years brought every kind of delay: fires, permits, supply issues, pauses, uncertainty.

When the [2023 Lahaina fires](https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/19/us/hawaii-maui-fires-saturday/index.html) hit, everything stopped. The whole island shifted its focus. Helping families. Finding shelter for neighbors. Figuring out what life looked like in the wake of loss. The gym slowed down so much that progress almost stopped.

But the six climbers behind this project chose to keep going. They moved forward in tiny, stubborn steps. One panel. One inspection. One meeting. One conversation. One "let's try again tomorrow."

And now? The walls are up. Holds sorted. Lights humming. AC running. Training gear ready. The only thing left is the final county approval—the last small but crucial hold before the send.

Founding members will even get a private test week. A warm-up lap before the crowd arrives.

## The Person Leading the Charge

If you've ever climbed on Maui, there's a good chance Jeff Jackson's name has floated your way. One of the gym's co-founders, Jeff brings a mix of experience that shows up in the way he talks, teaches, and leads.

He's an [English professor at UH Maui College](https://maui.hawaii.edu/english/). A long-time climber. A route developer with hundreds of lines established across Mexico and Maui. A former editor at [Rock and Ice magazine](https://www.rockandice.com/). A writer. A dad.

He understands the sport from both the physical and mental sides: how a climber breathes through a crux, how discipline builds power, how focus shapes movement.

After the fires, Jeff and his family didn't wait for instructions. They opened their home. Hosted families. Built a small backyard wall for kids who needed something familiar. Helped raise money for survivors. They stayed steady when things around them felt anything but.

That's why he calls Aloha Rock Gym "a community center disguised as a climbing gym."

## A Look Inside the Gym

Step into the 10,000 square-foot [Kahului](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahului,_Hawaii) warehouse and you'll see a space built for movement, strength, and steady improvement. Almost every inch has a purpose.

### The Walls

- **Roped climbing up to 40 feet**: [top rope, lead, and auto belay](/guides/bouldering-vs-rope-climbing)
- **Bouldering areas for all levels**: friendly slabs for beginners and steep, powerful terrain for seasoned climbers

Routes will get updated regularly. New problems, new challenges, new reasons to come back.

### Training Gear

If you want to get stronger, this is where you go:

- [Moonboard](https://moonboard.com/)
- Campus board
- Hangboards
- Full training area: racks, weights, cardio

You can train power, control, tension, finger strength—everything that makes a climber better.

### Extras

- Pro shop with gear
- Rental shoes, harnesses, chalk
- A clean lounge where you can rest, reset, and watch climbers work through problems

No clutter. No wasted space. Just a gym that understands [what climbers actually need](/guides/beginners-guide-to-climbing-gyms).

## Climbing With Purpose: The Kōkua Program

Aloha Rock Gym focuses on climbing and the people who walk through its doors. It's about care.

"Kōkua" means help or support, and the program carries that meaning into real action. Kids, teens, and families who need extra assistance—especially those deeply affected by the fires—get access to climbing at little or no cost.

Through partnerships with [Imua Family Services](https://imuafamilyservices.org/) and [Maui Economic Opportunity](https://meoinc.org/), the gym offers:

- After-school sessions
- Group climbs
- Safe space for movement and recovery
- A stable environment for kids rebuilding confidence

Members can even add a small "Kōkua support" option to their membership, turning their own training into support for someone else.

Climb for yourself. Help someone climb for the first time.

## Membership Options

Founding memberships are live now. They're lower than the regular rates and include:

- Early access to the gym

Kids' pricing stays simple and family-friendly:

## The Community Energy

People are ready. You can feel it on the island.

Online groups are buzzing. Friends send each other updates. Parents ask when they can bring their kids. Climbers—new and experienced—want a place to train consistently. Travelers plan to stop by between the airport and Costco.

Photos from early test sessions show kids grinning at the top of their first climbs. Adults clipping into routes they've waited years to climb. It's the kind of anticipation that spreads fast.

## A Strong Start for the Island

Aloha Rock Gym is opening at the right time for Maui. The community needs places that build strength: physical strength, yes, but also resilience, confidence, and connection.

ARG gives families a safe place to bring their kids. It gives climbers a home base. It gives Maui a space to move forward.

The building may be new, but the values behind it—patience, kindness, steady effort—have been here for years.
