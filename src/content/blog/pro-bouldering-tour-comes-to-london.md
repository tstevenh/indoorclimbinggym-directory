## TL;DR

<a href="https://www.proclimbingleague.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pro Climbing League</a> just picked London for 2026. <a href="https://www.the-font.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Font</a>. First UK event ever.

Olympic gold medalist Toby Roberts is confirmed. Head-to-head format. Two climbers. Same boulder. Same time. First one up wins.

Why is everyone freaking out?

Keep reading. You'll see.

Big news.

Really big.

I've been climbing since 1989. Thirty-five years. I've trained Olympic athletes. Written nine books on climbing performance. Seen every trend. Every fad. Every moment that actually mattered.

This one matters.

The Pro Climbing League just announced their first venue for 2026.

It's The Font. In London.

## What Is Pro Climbing League?

Two guys started it.

Danaan Markey—built multiple climbing businesses from the ground up, knows what works and what doesn't. Charlie Boscoe—you've heard his voice if you've ever watched climbing on TV, the guy who makes competitions make sense to normal people.

Simple idea. Brilliant execution.

Here's how most climbing competitions work.

Athletes sit alone in a room. Sometimes for hours. They wait. They stretch. They stare at walls. Then they walk out, climb for four minutes, and disappear again. The crowd claps politely. The next person comes out. Repeat.

It's fine.

Fine.

Just... fine.

PCL said no.

Forget that. Let's make it interesting.

Two climbers. Same boulder. Same time. Side by side. First one up wins.

That's it.

No waiting. No guessing. You watch two athletes go to war right in front of your face, and one of them wins while the other one doesn't, and you see it all happen in real time.

Pressure? Real.

Drama? Built in.

Stakes? $50,000 prize purse and world ranking points on the line.

It's climbing that feels like a fight. Like something is actually at stake.

Because something is.

## Why London? Why Now?

London's climbing scene exploded. Blew up.

Numbers don't lie. Since 2014? Five times more climbing centers. Five times. Participation up 43% in ten years. That's a movement. That's people voting with their feet and their wallets and their Wednesday evenings.

Then the Olympics happened.

Tokyo. Paris. Climbing on the world stage.

Toby Roberts—20 years old, British, wins gold.

Suddenly your coworker watches climbing videos at lunch. Your cousin texts you: "Is bouldering hard? Should I try it?" Your neighbor shows up at the gym in brand new climbing shoes, still with the tags on.

PCL sees this. They're smart.

Ride the wave. Start in London.

## The Venue: The Font

Don't know <a href="https://www.the-font.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Font</a>?

Let me tell you.

Wandsworth location. Over 11,000 square feet. Great walls. Seriously great. New routes every single week so you never get bored, never feel like you've done everything, always something fresh to try. Good coffee. Good beer. The kind of place where you show up at 10am and suddenly it's 6pm and you don't know where the day went.

That kind of place.

Is it perfect? No. Parking is a nightmare on weekends. Gets crowded during peak hours. But nobody cares because the climbing is that good.

They just merged with <a href="https://parthianclimbing.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parthian Climbing</a> too. Big move. By summer 2025 they'll have multiple locations. Bouldering AND rope climbing under one gym group. First time that's happened in London for a single operator.

For a pro event? The Font is perfect.

High ceilings. Walls you can reconfigure however you want. Room for 500 people to watch. Maybe more. The infrastructure is there. The vibe is there. The community is there.

But here's what really matters.

The Font is a real gym. Real climbers train there every day. They struggle. They fail. They get better. They come back.

That connection—grassroots to pro, everyday climber to Olympic athlete, your Tuesday night session to Toby Roberts competing for a title—that's what makes climbing special.

PCL gets it.

The Font gets it.

This has everything it needs to work. Quote me.

## How the Competition Works

Simple. Clean. Brutal.

**Qualifying Round.**

Two climbers. Three boulders. Go.

They climb at the same time. Simultaneously. First one to top a problem scores the point. Nobody tops? Whoever gets highest fastest wins. Done.

**Semi-Finals.**

Same thing. Two climbers. Two boulders. Winners advance.

**Finals.**

Four climbers left. Two boulders. Podium.

Each round? Less than ten minutes.

Here's what that feels like to watch.

Your heart rate doesn't come down until it's over. You forget to breathe. You lean forward without realizing it. You yell things you didn't plan to yell.

No downtime. No confusion. You watch. You understand. You know who's winning. Always.

I've been to a lot of competitions. A lot. Sat in audiences. Stood on the sidelines. Watched from commentary booths. Some competitions drag. Some confuse people. Some lose the crowd.

The PCL events I've seen don't.

Fast. Fair. Exciting.

## Who's Climbing?

Now we're talking.

Toby Roberts.

Confirmed.

If you don't know the name yet, you will. Trust me. Twenty years old. Won gold in Paris. Climbs V15 like most people climb V5. Just... does it. Makes it look easy.

Makes it look like the wall wants him to succeed. Like gravity forgot about him.

And he's British.

British kid. London crowd. Home turf.

Picture 500 people screaming his name. Picture him finishing a problem and the room shaking. Picture the moment he raises his fist and the whole place loses their minds.

That's coming.

Full roster isn't out yet. But expect names. Big ones.

Brooke Raboutou from the US—youngest climber ever to send V13, Olympic finalist at 20, and she's still getting better. Tomoa Narasaki from Japan—2019 World Champion, one of the most technical climbers alive. Akiyo Noguchi—four-time World Champion, a legend in every sense.

Mix of young talent and experienced pros.

PCL wants the best. They also want the next generation. That balance—legends and newcomers, experience and hunger—that's what keeps a sport alive.

That's what keeps it interesting.

## The Buzz Is Real

December 9, 2025. Announcement drops.

Then?

Everywhere.

X lit up. Climbing insiders sharing. Regular people sharing. Comments piling up.

"Finally."

"About time."

"London getting what it deserves."

The excitement is real. You can feel it.

Tickets? On sale soon. Date? Still secret. Probably early 2026. Maybe Q1. Maybe Q2.

But here's what I know about PCL events.

They sell out.

Fast.

Don't sleep on this.

Bigger picture though. Zoom out. Think about what this means.

One event in London could become two. Two could become a UK tour. A UK tour could inspire more investment. More gyms. More athletes getting support. More kids seeing a path forward in this sport.

That's the dream, anyway. And for the first time, it feels possible.

Climbing is growing. PCL is betting on that growth. London is where it starts.

The first hold has been set.

## What This Means for You

You.

Specifically you. Personally.

Maybe you've climbed for twenty years. Maybe you started last month. Maybe you've never touched a wall in your life but something about this sounds cool.

Doesn't matter. This affects you.

When pro events come to your city, everything rises. The energy. The inspiration. The sense that this thing you do—or this thing you're curious about—actually means something to the wider world.

Watching elite athletes crush problems is fun. Period. It's just fun. Makes you want to get on the wall yourself. Makes you want to try harder. Push further. See what you're capable of.

And here's what nobody tells you about climbing.

You watch Toby Roberts. You see his technique. His body position. His breathing. Then you go to the gym. You try it. Maybe you fall. Probably you fall. But you're doing the same thing he's doing. Just... worse. For now.

**The gap is small. Closeable.**

That's powerful.

That's why this sport hooks people.

## Find Your Gym and Start Climbing

Okay. I'm going to challenge you.

Don't just read this. Don't just scroll. Don't just think "oh that's cool" and move on with your day.

Do something.

If this got you excited—even a little—act on it.

Maybe you've never climbed. Start.

Maybe you used to climb but stopped. Go back.

Maybe you're looking for a new gym. Find one.

How?

Easy.

Go to [IndoorClimbingGym.com](/)

That's it. Simple directory. Type where you live. See what's near you. Beginner classes. Training facilities. Bouldering. Ropes. Whatever you need.

The 2026 PCL season is coming.

Toby Roberts is going to send it in London.

The sport is exploding.

Most people will read this and do nothing. You're still here. That means something.

Start. That's all. Just start. The rest figures itself out.

The wall only asks one thing. Show up.

Every single pro climber started somewhere. Every one. They walked into a gym. First time. Nervous. Confused. Fell off easy stuff. Felt weak. Felt uncoordinated. Felt like maybe this wasn't for them.

Then they came back.

And back.

And back.

Now they're competing in front of crowds. Winning medals. Making history.

Your first climb is waiting.

Today. Right now. This moment.

Go to [IndoorClimbingGym.com](/)

Find your gym.

Start climbing.
