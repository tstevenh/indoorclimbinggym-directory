## What Does It Mean to Clean Climbing Shoes Properly?

Cleaning climbing shoes means removing surface dirt, reducing odor-causing bacteria, managing moisture, and preserving the rubber components that give shoes their grip. This is maintenance, not deep washing. Climbing shoes consist of sensitive materials: sticky rubber rands and soles, synthetic or leather uppers, and absorbent linings. Each responds differently to water, heat, and chemicals. Proper cleaning addresses sweat residue, chalk buildup, and bacterial growth without compromising adhesive bonds or rubber integrity. Most climbers who maintain their shoes well use light surface cleaning and careful drying rather than soaking or machine washing.

**What proper cleaning includes:**

- Removing chalk residue from rubber and uppers
- Wiping down exterior surfaces with a damp cloth
- Allowing full drying between sessions
- Treating odor sources with gentle methods

**What it does not include:**

- Submerging shoes in water
- Using washing machines
- Applying heat for faster drying
- Using harsh chemicals or bleach

## Why Is It Important to Clean Climbing Shoes Regularly?

Regular cleaning extends shoe lifespan, maintains rubber performance, and prevents hygiene issues that affect both the climber and the [climbing gym](/search) environment. Sweat, dead skin cells, and chalk accumulate inside climbing shoes with every session. Bacteria thrive in this warm, moist environment and produce the compounds responsible for persistent odor. Over time, salt from sweat can degrade adhesives holding rubber to the upper. Chalk residue on the sole reduces friction. Neglected shoes often develop a slick rubber surface that compromises grip on holds. Climbers who clean regularly report their shoes lasting 25-40% longer than those who never clean them.

- Odor intensifies with each session if bacteria aren't controlled
- Rubber friction degrades when coated with chalk or body oils
- Adhesive failure becomes more likely with salt and moisture buildup
- Shoe shape can distort if left wet without proper drying

## How Do Climbing Shoes Get Dirty and Smelly?

Climbing shoes trap moisture, warmth, and organic matter in an enclosed space, creating ideal conditions for bacterial growth. The process starts with foot sweat absorbing into the lining during a climbing session. Most climbers produce 125-250ml of sweat per foot during an hour of activity. This moisture sits in the shoe's interior, especially if shoes go directly into a bag after climbing. Chalk dust enters through the opening and mixes with sweat residue. Bacteria metabolize dead skin cells and sweat compounds, releasing sulfur-based gases that produce the characteristic smell. Gym holds and mats transfer additional dirt and oils to the rubber sole. Without intervention, this cycle intensifies with each session.

**Typical accumulation timeline:**

1. Session 1-5: Light moisture buildup, minimal odor
2. Session 6-15: Noticeable smell when shoes removed from bag
3. Session 16-30: Strong odor, visible discoloration inside
4. Session 30+: Persistent smell even after airing, potential rubber degradation

## What Is the Safest Way to Clean Climbing Shoes at Home?

The safest method uses lukewarm water, mild soap, and controlled air drying without heat exposure. Fill a basin with room temperature water and add a small amount of mild dish soap or specialized shoe cleaner. Dampen a soft cloth or brush and gently wipe the exterior surfaces, including the rubber sole and rand. For the interior, use a barely damp cloth to wipe the lining without saturating it. Never submerge the entire shoe. After cleaning, stuff shoes loosely with newspaper or a dry cloth to absorb moisture. Place them in a well-ventilated area away from direct sunlight or heat sources. Full drying typically takes 24-48 hours depending on humidity.

**Step-by-step process:**

1. Remove loose dirt and chalk with a dry brush
2. Dampen cloth in lukewarm soapy water and wring thoroughly
3. Wipe rubber surfaces and exterior upper material
4. Use a barely damp cloth inside the shoe
5. Stuff with absorbent material and air dry completely

| Do | Don't |
|---|---|
| Use lukewarm or cool water | Use hot water |
| Apply mild soap sparingly | Use harsh detergents or bleach |
| Wipe surfaces gently | Scrub aggressively |
| Air dry completely before storage | Apply heat or direct sunlight |
| Stuff with paper to hold shape | Leave wet shoes in closed bag |

## Can You Wash Climbing Shoes in a Washing Machine?

Machine washing climbing shoes is generally not recommended due to risks to rubber bonding, shape retention, and adhesive integrity. The agitation and spin cycles create forces that can separate rubber from uppers, especially at the rand where adhesive bonds are critical for performance. Hot water in wash cycles softens adhesives and can cause permanent deformation. Synthetic shoes handle machine washing slightly better than leather, but neither type benefits from it. Some climbers report successfully machine washing heavily worn shoes they planned to resole anyway. For shoes in regular rotation, hand cleaning remains the safer choice.

| Factor | Hand Wash | Machine Wash |
|---|---|---|
| Rubber integrity | Preserved | Risk of separation |
| Shape retention | Maintained | May deform |
| Adhesive bonds | Unaffected | Weakened by heat/agitation |
| Time required | 15-20 minutes | 1+ hours including drying |
| Recommended for | All shoes | Last resort for heavily soiled, older shoes |

> Machine washing may extend a dying shoe's final months but typically accelerates the end for shoes with remaining life.

## How Often Should You Clean Your Climbing Shoes?

Cleaning frequency depends on session frequency, sweat output, and whether you climb indoors or outdoors. A climber training three times per week benefits from surface wiping after each session and deeper cleaning every two to four weeks. Heavy sweaters may need more frequent interior wipe-downs. Outdoor climbers dealing with dirt, sand, or mud should clean rubber more often to maintain friction. Infrequent climbers can clean before storage periods to prevent bacteria from developing in dormant shoes.

**By usage pattern:**

- Light use (1-2 sessions/week): Monthly deep clean, weekly airing
- Moderate use (3-4 sessions/week): Bi-weekly cleaning, post-session airing
- Heavy use (5+ sessions/week): Weekly cleaning, daily airing
- Outdoor climbing: After every session for rubber, weekly for full clean

**Example scenario:** A gym climber training Monday, Wednesday, and Friday airs shoes overnight after each session, wipes rubber weekly, and does a full hand-clean the last weekend of each month.

## What Are Common Mistakes When Cleaning Climbing Shoes?

New climbers at [beginner-friendly climbing gyms](/categories/best-climbing-gyms-for-beginners/) frequently damage shoes through well-intentioned cleaning mistakes that compromise materials. Hot water ranks as the most common error, softening adhesives and causing leather to shrink. Harsh detergents strip oils from leather and leave residue that affects rubber grip. Full submersion allows water to penetrate bonded seams where it stays trapped and weakens adhesives over time. Drying shoes in direct sunlight or near heaters accelerates rubber degradation and can cause permanent deformation. Using alcohol-based sprays or strong deodorants may mask odor temporarily but often damages interior linings.

**Common mistakes:**

- Using hot water for faster cleaning
- Soaking shoes to address deep odor
- Applying bleach or harsh bathroom cleaners
- Drying near heat sources or in direct sun
- Spraying deodorant directly on interior lining
- Machine drying or using hair dryers

| Mistake | Consequence |
|---|---|
| Hot water | Adhesive softening, leather shrinkage |
| Full submersion | Trapped moisture, weakened seams |
| Harsh detergents | Residue on rubber, dried-out leather |
| Heat drying | Rubber degradation, shape distortion |
| Strong sprays | Lining damage, transferred odor |

## Are There Different Cleaning Considerations for Leather vs. Synthetic Shoes?

Leather and synthetic uppers respond differently to water, retain odor differently, and require adjusted cleaning approaches. Leather absorbs water more readily and shrinks when dried with heat, making it essential to avoid saturation and control drying conditions. Leather shoes often stretch with use and can tighten significantly if cleaned improperly. Synthetic uppers resist water absorption but trap odor more stubbornly because they don't breathe as well. They tolerate slightly more moisture during cleaning but still shouldn't be soaked. Both materials share the same rubber components, which need identical care regardless of upper material.

| Factor | Leather Uppers | Synthetic Uppers |
|---|---|---|
| Water absorption | High | Low |
| Shrinkage risk | Significant if heat-dried | Minimal |
| Odor retention | Lower (breathes better) | Higher (traps smell) |
| Cleaning tolerance | Gentle wiping only | Slightly more moisture okay |
| Drying time | Longer | Shorter |
| Special care | Condition occasionally | Focus on odor control |

> Leather shoes that have stretched to fit perfectly can shrink a half-size or more if washed carelessly. Many climbers discover this the hard way.

## How Can You Reduce Odor Without Fully Washing Climbing Shoes?

Odor prevention through drying habits and targeted treatments reduces the need for frequent deep cleaning. The most effective approach starts immediately after climbing: remove shoes from bags, open them fully, and place in moving air. Bacteria need moisture to multiply, so consistent drying interrupts their growth cycle. Removable insoles, if present, should dry separately. Baking soda absorbs odors overnight when sprinkled inside, then shaken out before use. Cedar shoe inserts or activated charcoal pouches provide ongoing odor absorption between sessions. UV light shoe sanitizers kill bacteria without moisture but cost $30-60 for dedicated devices.

**Low-effort odor management:**

- Air shoes openly after every session (never leave in closed bag)
- Dry insoles separately
- Rotate between two pairs if training frequently
- Sprinkle baking soda overnight weekly
- Store with cedar or charcoal inserts
- Use gym lockers at [gyms with locker facilities](/categories/climbing-gyms-with-lockers/) to air shoes between sessions

**Example scenario:** A climber finishes a session, clips shoes to the outside of their gym bag, and hangs them in a ventilated mudroom at home. Once weekly, baking soda goes in overnight. Shoes remain odor-free for months without full cleaning.

## What Do Experienced Climbers Do to Keep Their Shoes Clean Long-Term?

Long-term shoe care among experienced climbers emphasizes prevention, rotation, and consistent low-effort maintenance over occasional deep cleaning. Most serious climbers own multiple pairs and rotate them to allow complete drying between sessions. They avoid wearing shoes off the wall, protecting rubber from abrasion on gym floors and outdoor surfaces. Light surface cleaning happens after every session, taking under two minutes. Storage occurs in open, ventilated spaces rather than sealed bags or dark closets. Shoes approaching end-of-life often get resoled rather than replaced, extending high-quality uppers another 6-12 months.

**Experienced climber routines:**

- Rotate 2-3 pairs to ensure each fully dries between uses
- Wipe rubber after every session with dry cloth
- Store in mesh bags or open shelving
- Never walk on gym floors or parking lots in climbing shoes
- Schedule resoling when rubber thins rather than replacing entire shoe
- Keep separate "project shoes" for hard routes and "volume shoes" for mileage

**Example scenario:** A climber with 5+ years experience owns aggressive shoes for bouldering, moderate shoes for sport routes, and an older pair for gym volume. Each pair airs on dedicated hooks. Rubber gets wiped with a dry cloth after sessions. Deep cleaning happens 3-4 times per year, primarily on the volume pair.

## Frequently Asked Questions About Cleaning Climbing Shoes

### Does cleaning climbing shoes reduce grip?

Cleaning does not reduce grip when done properly. Residue from sweat, chalk, and body oils actually decreases rubber friction over time. Clean rubber grips better than coated rubber. However, using harsh chemicals or leaving soap residue on the sole will reduce grip until worn off. Rinse rubber thoroughly after any soap contact and test grip on easy holds before committing to hard moves.

### Can baking soda be used inside climbing shoes?

Baking soda works effectively as an odor absorber inside climbing shoes. Sprinkle liberally inside the shoe, leave overnight or longer, then shake out completely before climbing. Residual powder won't affect performance but can feel gritty against bare feet. Some climbers put baking soda in thin socks placed inside shoes to simplify removal. Repeat weekly for ongoing odor management.

### Is it safe to use disinfectant sprays on climbing shoes?

Most disinfectant sprays are too harsh for climbing shoe materials and should be avoided. Alcohol-based sprays dry out leather and can damage synthetic linings. Household disinfectants may leave residue affecting rubber grip. If antibacterial treatment is needed, look for products specifically designed for athletic footwear or use diluted tea tree oil sparingly. Test any product on an inconspicuous area first.

### Should you clean new climbing shoes before first use?

Cleaning new climbing shoes before first use is unnecessary and not recommended. New shoes come with optimal rubber condition and no contaminants. Some manufacturing residue may exist but wears off naturally within the first session. Breaking in new shoes happens through climbing, not cleaning. Save your first cleaning for after several sessions when sweat and chalk have accumulated. For tips on choosing the right climbing shoes and other essential gear, check out our [climbing gear guide](/gear).

### How do you dry climbing shoes without damaging them?

Dry climbing shoes by maximizing airflow while avoiding heat. Remove any insoles and open the shoe tongue fully. Place in a ventilated area with moving air, away from direct sunlight, radiators, or heating vents. Stuffing with newspaper accelerates drying by absorbing interior moisture. Replace wet newspaper after a few hours. Complete drying takes 24-48 hours. Avoid the temptation to speed this process with hair dryers or clothes dryers.
