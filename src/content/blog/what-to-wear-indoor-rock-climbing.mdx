## Quick Answer: Indoor Climbing Outfit Essentials

**What to wear rock climbing indoor:** A fitted athletic shirt, stretchy pants or leggings, and climbing shoes (rental or purchased). That's it. You likely already own everything except the shoes, which every gym rents for $5-7.

Indoor rock climbing doesn't require specialized clothing on day one. Unlike skiing or hockey, you can start with basic athletic wear from your closet. This complete guide covers exactly what works, what to avoid, and smart buying decisions as you progress from first-timer to regular climber.

### The 3-Item Minimum Checklist

✓ **Top:** Fitted t-shirt, tank top, or sports bra (no loose fabric)
✓ **Bottom:** Leggings, athletic pants, or fitted shorts (must stretch)
✓ **Shoes:** Climbing shoes (rent first, buy after 10+ sessions)

Everything else—chalk, harnesses, accessories—comes later. Let's break down each category so you climb comfortably and confidently.

If you're new to climbing, check out our [complete beginner's guide to climbing gyms](/blog/beginners-guide-to-climbing-gyms) for step-by-step instructions on getting started.

## Why Your Climbing Outfit Matters

Your climbing clothes directly impact three things: safety, performance, and comfort. Understanding why certain clothing works (and why some items don't) helps you make smart choices without overspending.

### Safety First: Clothing Hazards to Avoid

Certain clothing items create genuine safety risks at climbing gyms:

- **Loose fabric:** Catches on holds during descents or falls
- **Jewelry:** Rings damage holds and cause finger injuries; necklaces snag in harnesses
- **Baggy sleeves:** Get trapped in belay devices and rope systems
- **Drawstrings:** Create entanglement hazards in equipment
- **Stiff materials:** Restrict emergency movements and quick reactions

### Performance: How Clothes Affect Your Climbing

The right outfit improves your climbing by enabling:

**Full Range of Motion:** High steps, wide reaches, and dynamic lunges require unrestricted movement. Stretchy materials outperform rigid fabrics by allowing 40-50% more leg extension.

**Temperature Regulation:** Climbing elevates your heart rate significantly. Moisture-wicking fabrics keep you 30-40% cooler than cotton by moving sweat away from skin.

**Spatial Awareness:** Fitted clothing lets you see your feet placement and body position. Baggy clothes block your view of critical footholds.

**Durability:** Climbing is hard on knees, inner thighs, and elbows. Purpose-built materials last 3-5x longer than regular athletic wear in these high-friction zones.

---

## Best Tops for Indoor Rock Climbing

Your top should allow full shoulder and arm mobility while staying out of your way. Here's what works best for different preferences and conditions.

### Athletic T-Shirts (Most Popular Choice)

**Best for:** Beginners, year-round climbing, modest coverage preferences

Standard fitted athletic t-shirts are the most common top at climbing gyms for good reason.

**Key Features:**
- Crew neck or v-neck styles
- Moisture-wicking polyester or poly-blend fabrics
- Fitted through torso (not tight, not loose)
- Full arm mobility at shoulder

**Price Range:** $15-$35
**Top Picks:** Any moisture-wicking running or workout shirt you already own

**Why they work:** T-shirts provide coverage without excess fabric bunching under harnesses or blocking your view. The fitted cut prevents catching on holds during reaches.

For more information on choosing the right gym for your needs, explore our guide to [best climbing gyms for beginners](/categories/best-climbing-gyms-for-beginners).

### Tank Tops and Sports Bras

**Best for:** Warm gyms, maximum mobility, experienced climbers

Many climbers prefer tank tops or just sports bras for cooling and range of motion.

**Tank Top Features:**
- Racerback styles prevent strap slippage
- Standard tanks work but straps may slide
- Fitted through torso

**Sports Bra Features:**
- Medium to high support depending on size
- Racerback or cross-back designs
- Many women climb in just sports bras when comfortable

**Price Range:** $20-$60
**Top Picks:** Any supportive athletic sports bra or racerback tank

**Why they work:** Removes shoulder fabric entirely, maximizing overhead reach. Provides excellent cooling during intense sessions.

### Long-Sleeve Options for Winter

**Best for:** Cold gyms, winter climbing, elbow protection

Long-sleeve athletic shirts work well in air-conditioned facilities or during winter.

**Key Features:**
- Thin, stretchy technical fabrics
- Thumbholes keep sleeves in place (bonus feature)
- Fitted through arms (not baggy)

**Price Range:** $25-$50
**Top Picks:** Running or yoga long-sleeves with 4-way stretch

**Why they work:** Provides warmth without bulk. Protects elbows during chimney climbing and wall contact.

### What NOT to Wear on Top

**❌ Cotton T-Shirts**
Cotton absorbs sweat and stays wet, becoming uncomfortable and heavy. Acceptable for first visit, but upgrade to synthetic blends quickly.

**❌ Extremely Loose or Oversized Shirts**
Excess fabric catches on holds, blocks your view of feet, and gets tangled in harnesses.

**❌ Hoodies with Drawstrings**
Drawstrings create safety hazards around belay devices and rope systems. Remove or tuck them away.

**❌ Shirts with Embellishments**
Rhinestones, sequins, or thick screen prints damage climbing holds (which costs gyms thousands to replace) and catch on texture.

---

## Best Bottoms: Pants and Shorts for Climbing Gym

Your pants are arguably more important than your top. They need serious stretch for high steps and wide stances while staying comfortable under harnesses.

### Leggings and Yoga Pants (Top Choice)

**Best for:** Maximum mobility, all-season climbing, most popular option

Athletic leggings dominate climbing gyms because they simply work better than any alternative for beginners and experts alike.

**Key Features:**
- 4-way stretch material (critical for high steps)
- High-waisted styles work best with harnesses
- Full-length or 7/8 length
- Thick enough to avoid see-through issues

**Price Range:** $20-$70
**Budget Options:** Target, Old Navy, Amazon basics ($20-$30)
**Premium Options:** Lululemon, Athleta, prAna ($70-$100)

**Why they work:** Leggings allow full leg extension without restriction. The fitted style won't catch on holds. High waists sit comfortably above harness leg loops. The stretchy material enables splits, high steps, and lunges impossible in rigid pants.

**Performance Note:** You can perform a high step at hip-height in leggings. In jeans, your maximum step height drops to mid-thigh level—severely limiting route options.

To understand how clothing affects your climbing ability across different difficulty levels, read our guide on [climbing grades explained](/blog/climbing-grades-explained).

### Climbing-Specific Pants

**Best for:** Frequent climbers (3+ times/week), outdoor climbers, durability seekers

Purpose-built climbing pants offer enhanced durability and mobility but aren't necessary for beginners.

**Key Features:**
- Reinforced knees and seat areas
- Gusseted crotch for maximum leg spread
- Stretchy yet durable fabrics
- Tapered legs prevent catching

**Price Range:** $60-$130
**Top Brands:** prAna, Outdoor Research, Black Diamond

**Why they work:** Built specifically for climbing's unique movement patterns. Reinforcements last 3-5x longer than regular athletic pants in high-wear areas.

**When to buy:** After 20+ climbing sessions when you know you're committed. Not worth the investment for casual climbers.

### Shorts for Warm Weather Climbing

**Best for:** Summer climbing, warm gyms, bouldering

Athletic shorts provide excellent mobility and cooling but require the right style.

**Key Features:**
- Above-knee length (not ultra-short)
- Stretchy athletic material
- Fitted or semi-fitted cut
- Avoid loose basketball-style shorts

**Price Range:** $15-$45
**Top Picks:** Running shorts, training shorts with stretch

**Why they work:** Maximum cooling while maintaining mobility. Fitted styles move with your body without riding up or restricting movement.

**Caution:** Very short shorts ride up uncomfortably when pressing legs against walls. Choose mid-thigh length for best results.

### Joggers and Sweatpants (Casual Option)

**Best for:** Casual climbing, beginners, comfort-first approach

Joggers offer a comfortable middle ground between leggings and jeans.

**Key Features:**
- Tapered or fitted leg (not baggy)
- Stretchy waistband and fabric
- Cotton-poly blends

**Price Range:** $20-$50

**Why they work:** More forgiving fit than leggings while maintaining decent mobility. Good beginner option if you're not ready for tight athletic wear.

**Limitation:** Less durable than purpose-built options and slightly restrict maximum leg extension compared to leggings.

### What NOT to Wear on Bottom

**❌ Jeans or Rigid Pants**
Denim and stiff materials are the #1 beginner mistake. They severely restrict leg movement, making high steps and wide stances uncomfortable or impossible. Your climbing grade will be 2-3 levels lower in jeans.

**❌ Very Short Shorts**
Ultra-short shorts (2-3 inch inseam) ride up uncomfortably and provide no protection when legs press against walls. Choose at least 5-6 inch inseam.

**❌ Loose Basketball Shorts**
Baggy athletic shorts restrict movement despite being athletic wear. The loose fabric bunches, rides up, and catches. Choose fitted athletic shorts instead.

**❌ Pants with Belts and Belt Loops**
Heavy belts interfere with climbing harnesses and add unnecessary bulk. Elastic waistbands work better.

**❌ Cargo Pants or Shorts**
Extra pockets add weight, limit mobility, and create uncomfortable pressure points under harnesses.

## Climbing Shoes: Complete Beginner's Guide

Climbing shoes are the only truly essential piece of climbing-specific gear. They transform your ability to use small footholds and maintain wall contact. Here's exactly when to rent versus buy.

Learn more about proper fitting and selection in [REI's comprehensive climbing shoe guide](https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/rock-shoes.html).

### Should You Rent or Buy Climbing Shoes?

This decision depends on your climbing frequency and commitment level.

#### When to RENT Climbing Shoes

**Rent if you:**
- Are trying climbing for the first time
- Visit gyms less than 2-3 times per month
- Haven't decided if climbing is your sport
- Are traveling and visiting an unfamiliar gym

**Rental Cost:** $5-$7 per visit
**Pros:** Zero upfront cost, try climbing risk-free, change sizes easily
**Cons:** Worn-in fit may not be ideal, hygiene concerns, costs accumulate

**Rental Math:** At $6 per visit, you'll spend $60 after 10 sessions and $120 after 20 sessions. This helps calculate your break-even point for purchasing.

For a detailed breakdown of climbing gym costs including equipment rentals, check out our guide on [how much it costs to climb at a gym](/blog/how-much-does-climbing-gym-cost).

#### When to BUY Climbing Shoes

**Buy if you:**
- Climb 2+ times per week consistently
- Have completed 10-15 sessions and know you're committed
- Want performance improvement over worn rentals
- Calculate you'll break even in 3-4 months

**Purchase Cost:** $80-$150 for quality beginner shoes
**Pros:** Perfect fit, better performance, hygiene, long-term savings
**Cons:** $80-$150 upfront investment

**Purchase Math:** At $6 per rental, buying $90 shoes breaks even after 15 visits. If you climb twice weekly, that's under 2 months.

### How Climbing Shoes Should Fit

Climbing shoe fit differs significantly from street shoes and confuses most beginners.

**For Beginners (Comfort Fit):**

Your first climbing shoes should fit snugly but comfortably. You should wear them for 30-45 minutes without significant pain.

✓ **Correct Fit Indicators:**
- Toes touch the front without curling painfully
- No dead space at heel
- Snug through midfoot without pinching
- Feels like a firm handshake—present but not painful
- Can stand on small edges without agonizing pain

✗ **Too Tight Indicators:**
- Can't wear them for more than 5-10 minutes
- Toes curl or scrunch uncomfortably
- Throbbing or shooting pains
- Numbness in toes

✗ **Too Loose Indicators:**
- Heel lifts when standing on toes
- Foot slides inside shoe
- Dead space anywhere
- Feels like a street shoe

**Common Question:** "Should climbing shoes hurt?"

**Answer:** Not for beginners. Experienced climbers wear very tight shoes for performance on advanced routes, but beginners need comfort to learn technique and build confidence. Your shoes should feel snug like compression socks—firm but not painful.

### Do You Wear Socks with Climbing Shoes?

The sock question confuses many first-timers. Here's the actual answer:

**Most Climbers:** No socks for better feel, sensitivity, and precise foot placement

**With Rental Shoes:** Socks are acceptable and common for hygiene reasons

**With Your Own Shoes:** Go sockless for best performance (size shoes accordingly)

**For Comfort:** Wear thin athletic socks if you prefer, especially as a beginner

**Hygiene:** Sockless is standard. Air out shoes after each session and use shoe deodorizers.

The "better feel" means you can sense subtle foot positions and adjust pressure distribution across your toes—improving your climbing by 15-20% compared to socked feet.

## Essential Climbing Gym Accessories

Beyond clothing and shoes, a few accessories improve your climbing experience significantly.

### Chalk and Chalk Bags Explained

**What it is:** Magnesium carbonate powder that absorbs hand moisture and improves grip by 40-60%.

**Do you need it?** Yes, especially after your first 2-3 sessions when you attempt routes requiring sustained grip.

**Cost Options:**
- **Gym Community Chalk:** $0-$3 per visit (many gyms provide)
- **Personal Chalk Bag:** $15-$25
- **Chalk Refills:** $10-$15 (lasts 3-6 months)

**Chalk Types Comparison:**

| Type | Messiness | Cost | Best For |
|------|-----------|------|----------|
| Block Chalk | Medium | $10/lb (cheapest) | Experienced climbers, outdoor |
| Loose Chalk | High | $12/lb | Performance climbing |
| Chalk Balls | Low | $8-$10 | Gym climbing (contained) |
| Liquid Chalk | Very Low | $12-$15 | Eco-friendly gyms, minimal mess |

**Beginner Recommendation:** Start with chalk balls or gym-provided chalk. Invest in your own chalk bag and loose chalk after 10+ sessions.

### Harnesses for Rope Climbing

**When You Need One:** Only for top rope or lead climbing. Bouldering doesn't require harnesses.

**Rental Cost:** $5-$8 per visit
**Purchase Cost:** $50-$80 for beginner harnesses

**When to Buy:** If you rope climb 2+ times per week, buying makes financial sense within 2-3 months. Plus, your own harness fits better and feels more comfortable.

**Beginner Harness Features to Look For:**
- Adjustable leg loops (fit over different clothing)
- Padded waist belt (comfort during falls and hanging)
- Multiple gear loops (hold chalk bag, belay device)
- Easy-to-use buckle system (double-back or auto-locking)

**Top Beginner Harnesses:**
- **Black Diamond Momentum:** $60 - Most popular beginner harness
- **Petzl Corax:** $65 - Excellent comfort
- **Arc'teryx AR-395a:** $75 - Premium comfort and durability

### Other Useful Accessories

**Water Bottle (Essential)**
Bring at least 24 oz. Climbing is dehydrating—expect to drink 16-32 oz per hour. Most gyms have refill stations.

**Small Towel ($5-$15)**
Wipe sweat from hands between attempts. Improves grip by removing oils and moisture.

**Hair Ties**
Long hair must be tied back for safety. Keeps hair out of belay devices and maintains clear vision during climbs.

**Athletic Tape ($5-$10 per roll)**
Finger taping for support or hot spots. Not necessary for beginners but useful after 20+ sessions when your fingers strengthen.

**Nail Clippers**
Keep fingernails very short. Long nails break on holds and prevent proper finger pad contact.

## What to Wear for Different Climbing Styles

Different climbing styles have slightly different outfit priorities.

### Bouldering Outfit Requirements

**Focus:** Mobility and knee protection

Bouldering involves lots of knee contact with walls and dynamic movements requiring maximum flexibility.

**Ideal Bouldering Outfit:**
- Fitted t-shirt or tank top
- Full-length athletic leggings (protects knees)
- Climbing shoes
- Chalk bag on ground nearby

**Why:** Full-length pants protect knees during knee bars, wall contact, and potential scrapes. The fitted top allows full trunk rotation for dynamic moves.

If you're interested in bouldering specifically, explore our directory of the [best bouldering climbing gyms](/categories/best-bouldering-climbing-gyms) in your area. For help understanding bouldering difficulty ratings, check our [bouldering grade conversion tool](/tools/bouldering-grade-conversion).

### Top Rope Climbing Attire

**Focus:** Harness compatibility and sustained comfort

Top rope climbing sessions last longer, so comfort becomes more important.

**Ideal Top Rope Outfit:**
- Any athletic shirt
- Comfortable stretchy pants or shorts
- Harness over clothing
- Climbing shoes
- Chalk bag clipped to harness

**Harness Fit Note:** High-waisted pants work better than low-rise options. The harness waist belt sits at your natural waist, and high-rise pants prevent uncomfortable bunching.

To understand top rope climbing difficulty progression, visit our [sport climbing grade conversion tool](/tools/sport-climbing-grade-conversion).

### Lead Climbing Attire

**Focus:** Maximum mobility and durability

Lead climbing demands explosive moves and creates more wear on clothing.

**Ideal Lead Outfit:**
- Fitted athletic top
- Stretchy pants with reinforced knees (climbing-specific preferred)
- Comfortable, broken-in harness
- Performance climbing shoes (tighter fit)
- Chalk bag on harness

**Why:** Lead climbing requires reaching high clips in awkward positions. Maximum mobility is critical. Reinforced pants protect against repeated wall abrasion.

## Budget-Friendly Climbing Clothing Guide

You don't need expensive gear to start climbing. Here's how to outfit yourself at three budget levels.

For a complete breakdown of all climbing costs beyond clothing, see our detailed guide on [how much climbing gym membership costs](/blog/how-much-does-climbing-gym-cost).

### Under $30: Use What You Have

**Start with clothing you already own:**

✓ Any fitted athletic t-shirt: **$0**
✓ Yoga pants or athletic shorts: **$0**
✓ Athletic socks (for rental shoes): **$0**
✓ Water bottle: **$0**

**Add rentals:**
✓ Climbing shoes rental: **$5-$7 per visit**
✓ Gym chalk: **$0-$3 per visit**

**Total First Visit Cost: $5-$10** (plus gym day pass: $15-$25)

This option works perfectly for your first 5-10 visits while you decide if climbing is your sport.

### $50-$100: Starter Investment

If you're committed after a few sessions but want to stay budget-conscious:

**New Purchases:**
- 2 fitted athletic t-shirts (Target/Old Navy): **$20-$30**

## Climbing Gym Dress Code: What You Need to Know

Most climbing gyms have relaxed dress codes focused on safety and hygiene rather than modesty or fashion.

### Universal Rules at All Gyms

These requirements apply at virtually every climbing facility:

✓ **Closed-toe shoes required** - Climbing shoes or clean sneakers (no sandals, no bare feet)

✓ **Shirt required** - Though sports bras alone are often acceptable for women in most gyms

✓ **Athletic attire** - Appropriate for physical activity (no jeans or street clothes on walls)

✓ **Clean shoes on walls** - No outdoor street shoes on climbing surfaces (switch to clean sneakers or climbing shoes)

✓ **No offensive graphics** - Family-friendly environment

### Common Restrictions

Some gyms prohibit specific items:

**For Safety:**
- Heavy jewelry (rings, bracelets, watches damage holds)
- Dangling necklaces (snag in harnesses)
- Clothing with drawstrings (entanglement hazard)

**For Facility Protection:**
- Street shoes on crash pads or walls
- Chalk types (some gyms ban loose chalk, require chalk balls only)

**Check Your Specific Gym:** Visit their website or call ahead if you're uncertain about dress code details. Most gyms post dress codes on their FAQ pages. [Search for climbing gyms near you](/search) to find facility-specific dress code information.

---

## Seasonal Climbing Outfit Adjustments

Your climbing outfit should adapt to gym temperature and seasonal weather.

### Summer/Warm Weather Clothing

When gyms run warm or during summer months:

**Recommended:**
- **Tops:** Tank tops, lightweight t-shirts, sports bras
- **Bottoms:** Shorts, capris, lightweight leggings
- **Extras:** Extra water (32+ oz), sweatband for forehead, small towel

**Temperature Impact:** Warm gyms (75°F+) reduce your climbing endurance by 15-20%. Lighter clothing helps maintain performance.

### Winter/Cold Weather Clothing

When gyms run cool or during winter:

**Recommended:**
- **Tops:** Long-sleeve shirts, light hoodie for between climbs
- **Bottoms:** Full-length leggings, joggers
- **Layers:** Light jacket for warm-up and cool-down periods

**Layering Strategy:** You'll warm up within 10-15 minutes once climbing. Dress in removable layers rather than one thick layer.

### Climate-Controlled Gyms (Most Common)

Most modern climbing facilities maintain consistent comfortable temperatures:

**Typical Year-Round Temperature:** 65-70°F (18-21°C)
**Recommendation:** Standard athletic wear works well all year
**Strategy:** Bring one light layer if you tend to get cold easily

---

## Comparison: Climbing Outfit Options

Here's a quick-reference comparison of different outfit approaches:

| Outfit Type | Mobility | Durability | Cost | Best For |
|-------------|----------|------------|------|----------|
| **Leggings + Athletic Top** | Excellent | Good | $30-$100 | All climbers, especially beginners |
| **Climbing-Specific Pants + Top** | Excellent | Excellent | $120-$200 | Frequent climbers (3+ times/week) |
| **Shorts + Tank Top** | Excellent | Good | $30-$70 | Warm weather, bouldering |
| **Joggers + T-Shirt** | Good | Fair | $35-$80 | Casual climbers, comfort-first |
| **Jeans + Regular Shirt** | Poor | Good | $40-$100 | ❌ Not recommended |

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I wear regular sneakers instead of climbing shoes?

No, not for actual climbing. Regular athletic shoes lack the sticky rubber, precise fit, and specialized sole that climbing shoes provide. Your ability to use footholds drops by 60-70% in sneakers compared to climbing shoes.

Sneakers are fine for walking around the gym, but always rent or buy climbing shoes for the walls themselves. This is the one non-negotiable piece of climbing-specific gear.

### Can you wear jeans rock climbing?

Technically yes, but you absolutely shouldn't. Jeans severely restrict your leg movement—reducing your maximum high-step by 40-50% compared to stretchy pants.

For your very first visit, jeans might work for easy beginner routes, but you'll be uncomfortable and frustrated. Even basic athletic wear from a discount store ($20-$25) vastly improves your experience and climbing ability.

### What if I don't own athletic leggings?

Athletic shorts, joggers, sweatpants, or even loose basketball shorts work for trying climbing. If you continue with the sport, invest in stretchy pants or leggings for significantly better mobility and comfort.

Many beginners start with what they have and upgrade after 5-10 sessions once they're committed. For guidance on choosing your first gym, visit our guide to [best climbing gyms for beginners](/categories/best-climbing-gyms-for-beginners).

### Should I bring a change of clothes?

Optional but recommended. Climbing is sweaty work—many climbers bring fresh clothes for after their session. Most gyms have changing rooms, showers, and lockers.

If you're climbing during lunch or before work/social plans, definitely bring a change of clothes.

### Do I really need chalk?

For your first visit or two, chalk is optional—your grip strength is the limiting factor, not hand moisture. By session 3-5, chalk becomes helpful as you attempt sustained routes requiring grip endurance.

Most gyms provide community chalk for free or $2-3. Use this until you climb regularly enough to justify buying your own chalk bag ($15-$25).

### Is it weird to climb in just a sports bra?

Not at all. Sports bras are common and acceptable at most climbing gyms, especially in warm weather. Many women climb in just sports bras or sports bras with open shirts.

Wear whatever makes you comfortable. Climbing culture is generally accepting and focused on the climbing itself rather than clothing choices.

---

## Getting Started: Your Action Plan

### First Visit Checklist

**Bring from Home:**
✓ Fitted athletic t-shirt or tank top
✓ Stretchy pants, leggings, or athletic shorts
✓ Athletic socks (for rental shoes)

New to climbing? Our [beginner's guide to climbing gyms](/blog/beginners-guide-to-climbing-gyms) walks you through everything you need to know for your first visit.

### After 5-10 Sessions: Consider First Purchase

If climbing becomes a regular activity, invest in climbing shoes first.

**Why Shoes First:**
- Improves climbing performance by 25-30%
- Saves $5-$7 every visit (breaks even in 15-20 visits)
- Ensures proper fit and hygiene
- Signals commitment to the sport

**Where to Buy:**
- **Local gym pro shops:** Expert fitting, support your gym
- **REI or outdoor retailers:** Excellent return policies, seasonal sales
- **Online:** Backcountry, Moosejaw (if you know your size)

**Avoid:** Used climbing shoes unless very lightly used. Shoes mold to feet, so used shoes fit poorly.

### Finding Gear Deals

**Best Shopping Strategies:**

**End-of-Season Sales:**
Buy summer clothing in fall (September-October) and winter gear in spring (March-April) for 30-50% discounts.

**REI Member Sales:**
REI members get dividend payments (10% back) and exclusive sale access. $30 lifetime membership pays for itself quickly.

**Black Friday/Holiday Sales:**
Outdoor retailers offer 20-40% off climbing gear during major shopping holidays.

**Gym Pro Shop Clearances:**
Local climbing gyms clear previous-year inventory at 25-40% off. Ask when they typically discount.

**Used Gear:**
Check gym swap boards and climbing community Facebook groups for used clothing (not shoes or harnesses).
