On January 25, 2026, Alex Honnold free soloed Taipei 101—all 508 meters (1,667 feet) of it—without ropes, harness, or safety equipment. The 40-year-old climber completed the first-ever ropeless ascent of Taiwan's iconic skyscraper in 1 hour, 31 minutes, and 43 seconds, broadcast live on Netflix to millions worldwide.

This wasn't a spur-of-the-moment decision. Honnold had been seeking permission for over a decade, initially turned down, before finally getting the green light. What happened that day has sparked conversations across the climbing community—and well beyond it.

## The Climb That Everyone Watched

The livestream on Netflix, titled "Skyscraper Live," featured multiple camera angles, including a made-in-Taiwan 360-degree 4K panoramic view from nearby Elephant Mountain. Netflix used a 10-second broadcast delay, reportedly "just in case"—a decision that's generated its own set of debates.

Honnold wore his signature look: red T-shirt, yellow climbing shoes. He moved methodically up the glass-and-steel southeast face, pausing briefly on a mid-level platform to wave at fans. Below him, crowds filled the streets. Inside the building, people watched from the 89th-floor observatory, some knocking on windows as he passed.

At the summit spire, he pulled out his phone and took a selfie. That image has since gone viral, with reactions ranging from "iconic" to "stress-inducing." He rappelled down safely afterward and was greeted by his wife, Sanni McCandless Honnold.

The climb was originally scheduled for January 24 but was delayed a day due to weather—a reminder that even the most prepared climbers adjust to conditions.

## Why This Building?

Taipei 101 isn't just tall. It's designed to resemble a bamboo stalk, engineered for earthquake resistance in one of the world's most seismically active regions. That structural design, ironically, provided the features Honnold needed: edges, textures, and anchor points on what's otherwise a sleek modern facade.

According to the <a href="https://www.ifsc-climbing.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC)</a>, urban climbing on skyscrapers represents a growing category of the sport, though sanctioned climbs like this remain rare. Most building climbs are unauthorized, often resulting in arrests. Honnold's climb was legal, negotiated, and monitored.

The building stands as one of Asia's tallest, though it's since been surpassed by others in height. What made it compelling wasn't just the elevation—it was the symbolic weight. Taiwan rallied around the event, with local and international crowds showing up to witness it in person.

## The Gear (and Lack Thereof)

Free soloing means no ropes. No harness. No safety net. You're relying entirely on your ability to hold on.

Honnold's setup was minimal: climbing shoes designed for maximum friction, chalk for grip, and years of preparation. For those wondering what goes into that level of climbing, it starts with the fundamentals—footwork, body positioning, and hand strength.

## The Reactions: Awe and Unease

Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te congratulated Honnold on social media, describing the climb as "heart-pounding" and "inspiring." The climbing community, predictably, was split.

Some see it as the logical extension of what Honnold's been doing for years. His 2017 free solo of El Capitan in Yosemite—documented in the Oscar-winning film "Free Solo"—set a standard that few will ever attempt. This was that, but vertical glass instead of granite.

Others expressed concern. Not about Honnold's skill—that's not in question—but about the decision to broadcast it live. What if something had gone wrong? What message does it send about risk, especially to younger climbers who might not fully grasp the years of preparation behind a climb like this?

The ethical debate isn't new. <a href="https://www.usaclimbing.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">USA Climbing</a>, the national governing body for competition climbing, has long emphasized safety protocols and proper training. Free soloing exists in a different realm—legal, respected in some circles, but not something governing bodies promote.

Honnold himself has always been transparent about the risks. In post-climb interviews, he reflected on the decade-long wait for permission, calling the moment "really extraordinary." He also joked about his Netflix paycheck being an "embarrassingly small amount" relative to the feat—a reminder that even at this level, professional climbing isn't always lucrative.

## What It Takes to Train for Something Like This

You don't wake up one day and free solo a skyscraper. Honnold's preparation involved years of route study, physical conditioning, and mental rehearsal. That level of finger strength and endurance comes from consistent training.

For most of us, the goal isn't free soloing skyscrapers. It's progressing from V0 to V3, getting comfortable on lead routes, or just enjoying the problem-solving aspect of climbing.

## The Bigger Picture

Honnold emphasized in interviews that "hard work makes tough things possible" and that "time shouldn't be wasted." He's 40 now. His approach to climbing has matured, factoring in family, risk assessment, and legacy.

This climb will be studied, debated, and referenced for years. It's a data point in the ongoing conversation about what's possible in climbing, what's responsible, and where the line falls between inspiration and spectacle.

For Taiwan, it was a moment of national pride—a showcase of human perseverance on one of their most iconic structures. For the climbing world, it's another chapter in Honnold's career, one that reinforces his position as one of the most skilled—and most scrutinized—climbers alive.

## What This Means for You

If you're inspired by what Honnold does, start where everyone starts: in a gym, with an instructor, learning the basics. Free soloing is the extreme end of a spectrum. The accessible end—the part that builds community, fitness, and problem-solving skills—happens in [climbing gyms across the country](/search).

The fundamentals remain the same whether you're climbing indoors or watching someone scale a skyscraper. Footwork. Body positioning. Mental focus. The difference is the consequence of error.

Most of us will never free solo anything. That's fine. The joy of climbing doesn't require it.
