## Understanding Climbing Gym Pricing

If you're new to indoor climbing or considering joining a climbing gym, one of your first questions is likely: "How much is this going to cost?" The answer varies significantly depending on your location, the gym you choose, and how often you plan to climb.

In this comprehensive guide, we'll break down all the costs associated with climbing at a gym, from day passes to annual memberships, equipment rentals, and those hidden fees that might surprise you.

## Day Pass Prices

Most climbing gyms offer day passes for visitors who want to try climbing without committing to a membership. Here's what you can typically expect:

### National Average Pricing

A day pass typically includes:
- Access to all climbing walls (bouldering and top rope)

### What's NOT Included

- Climbing shoes (usually $5-$7 rental fee)
- Harness and belay device (usually $5-$8 rental fee)
